# Instructions for Use
Synchronous acquisition and analysis for sEMG-MMG. **NI9205** and **TCP/IP** were used to collect data generated by **Quspin** and **BioSemi**.
- Analog data acquisition of **QuSpin** (OPMs device), **BioSemi** (sEMG/ECG device), **CIYENIC** (muscle force device) and other devices is performed through the **cDAQ** unit of National Instruments. This interface leads to multiple data streams of different devices, multi-threaded synchronous execution, the core technology around **NI-DAQmx**, **PsychToolBox/PsychoPy** and **TCP/IP** protocols. **NI-DAQmx** is based on the ctypes library and is a complex, highly object-oriented wrapper for developing **C API** implementations. The **Serial/Parallel** protocol controls and records stimulus levels via a serial port or parallel port (**LPT** driver required, **InpOut32/64** is an open source Windows **DLL** and driver for direct access to hardware ports).
- **PsychoPy** is based on the underlying controls of the **PsychToolBox**, combining the graphics rendering benefits of OpenGL with syntax to provide stimulus presentation and control, with asynchronous high-precision planned timing, for cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology research. **TCP/IP** protocol wirelessly obtains real-time sensor information through data stream interception.
- When the connection state, display state, acquisition state, and stimulus indicator light are all on, click to start recording data and click Pause to end recording, and the data will be automatically saved as 3 independent files.
  
You can download the **UI_Collector.exe** tool in <a href="https://github.com/transover/sEMG-MMG_SYNC/releases/UI_Collector">Release</a> for the task of sEMG-MMG acquisition, as shown in the following figure:

</div>

### 1. Using the NI9205 Acquisition Board and Installing the NI Driver:
- In the `NI-DAQmx_driver` directory, run `ni-daqmx_24.0_online.exe` and select the default installation settings.

### 2. Using the BioSemi Acquisition Device and Installing the TCP/IP Server:
- Download `ACTIVIEW806` from the `BioSemi` directory and use it directly. If LabView files are missing, install `LabView RuntimeEngine 2016 (64bit)/setup.exe`.
- Run the batch file in the `BioSemi` directory to launch `ActView806-Lores.exe`, and select the configuration file `ACTIVIEW806/Configuring/sEMG_A32_Config.cfg`.
- Set the TCP Server local port to `8888`, and choose TCP subset `A1~A32 (32)`.

### 3. Completing TCP/IP Connection and Viewing Acquisition Changes on ActView806 by Selecting A1~A32 After Successful Connection:
#### Steps:
1. When the user starts collecting data, the server's TCP Listening round icon turns green, indicating that Biosemi ActiveTwo is listening and ready to establish a connection.
2. After the user runs the client function and connects successfully, the TCP Connected circular icon in Biosemi ActiveTwo will turn green, indicating that Biosemi is transmitting data to the client.
3. Read data (Once the connection is established, parameters are disabled and can only be modified after the connection is terminated. The number of bytes received and transmitted is also reported in Biosemi ActiveTwo.)

#### Notes:
1. Users must ensure that the TCP/IP function parameters in the client match those set in Biosemi ActiveTwo.
2. Note that since Biosemi ActiveTwo acts as a server, a connection cannot be established unless Biosemi ActiveTwo is running in display or recording mode.
3. Parameters in Biosemi ActiveTwo are located on the TCP Server tab and must be adjusted before running Biosemi ActiveTwo. Once Biosemi ActiveTwo starts data acquisition, even in display mode, parameters cannot be changed.
4. Be careful to select the number of channels; otherwise, even if the connection is successful, data cannot be read.
5. Streaming through TCP/IP introduces several hundred milliseconds of delay and tens of milliseconds of jitter. Data streamed via TCP/IP cannot be used directly for precise timing and requires buffering.

#### Parameters (TCP/IP parameters used for connecting with Biosemi):
- IP address (host):
    If running on the same machine as Biosemi ActiveTwo, set it to **127.0.0.1**. Otherwise, use the IP address of the machine running Biosemi ActiveTwo.
- Port (port):
    The port used for communication. It must match the port reported by the TCP server in Biosemi ActiveTwo. The default value is **8888**.
- Samples per packet (tcpsamples):
    This defines the number of sample points included in each packet sent by Biosemi ActiveTwo. It depends on the sampling rate chosen by the user.
- Bytes per sample (bytes):
    This defines the number of bytes used to represent each sample. It is fixed regardless of the sampling rate and cannot be changed by the user.
- Channels + triggers (channels):
    This shows the number of selected channels (plus triggers). It is controlled by the channels setting, which will be described later in the parameters section dedicated to EMG data (section: Biosemi parameters).
    This value must match the one reported by Biosemi ActiveTwo.

# Optimization
### **✨ New Function**  
- New functions such as **Magnetomyography (MMG)**, **Electromyography (EMG)**, **Muscle Power Assessment (MPA)** have been added.
- The main interface supports translation between Chinese and English, adds preloading of subject information, real-time data acquisition, display and saving, and uses process isolation and asynchronous execution in multiple tasks.
- The **NI9205** hardware voltage bias has been added. The baseline voltage detected when no hardware is connected (which can be regarded as a constant amount for a short period of time) has been software-calibrated in the program (updated on '2024-5-16 23:08').
- After clicking the button **[Record]**, enter the automatic save mode. The save location is in the './GUI_Output' directory of the same directory as exe. The data composition can be seen in './Help'.

### **⚡ Improvement**  
- **Performance Enhancement**: Developed in environments like `gcc` and `python310`, compiled into `C` project files, achieving a speed increase of over 30% for the modules.  
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Leveraged low-level control through `PsychToolBox` to achieve sub-millisecond stimulus delay, with state markers ensuring data synchronization across different virtual channels.  
- **Compilation Optimization**: Disabled slow operations such as `LTO` and debug symbols, streamlined dependencies for parallel packaging, significantly reducing library resource dependencies, dynamic library calls, and external dependency issues.  
- **UI Enhancement**: Developed using the `ctypes` library, supporting the `nidaqmx` library (implementing complex, highly object-oriented wrappers around the `NI-DAQmx C API`).  

### **🐛 Bug Fixes**  
- Fixed thread crash issues caused by `Process finished with exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005)` access violation errors.  
- Resolved missing driver compatibility issues for `psychopy.parallel._inpout`.  
- Fixed `UnboundLocalError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and crash issues caused by missing temporary compressed packages (embedded resources).  

### **📦 Dependency Updates**  
- Upgraded `psychopy` to version 2023.  
- File resources are located under the `./GUI_Package` directory in the compressed package, where users can modify participant information files (csv) and bias files (pkl).
